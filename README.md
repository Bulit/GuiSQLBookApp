# GuiSQLBookApp
 
## An app for cataloguing your home library. Allows you to add a title, author, year of publication and a unique ISBN number. Added items can be freely modified and deleted. It is also possible to search our database for a specific book.

### TechStack:
:snake: Python (Tkinter), SQLite

@TODO
- searching by non-complete criteria. ex. instead of looking for Earthsea, we can type sea. The app should search for all items meeting the specified criteria.
